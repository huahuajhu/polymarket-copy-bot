A Python-based simulated copy-trading bot for Polymarket that allows you to backtest and paper trade by copying a "leader" trader's positions on BTC price predictions.

## Features

- **Market**: BTC price UP/DOWN predictions
- **Timeframe**: 15-minute resolution candles
- **Modes**: 
  - Backtest: Test strategy on historical simulated data
  - Paper Trading: Practice with simulated real-time data
- **Strategy**: Copy a leader trader's positions with confidence-based position sizing
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Total PnL (Profit and Loss)
  - Win rate
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Confusion matrix (UP/DOWN prediction accuracy)
  - Precision and recall metrics

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huahuajhu/polymarket-copy-bot.git
cd polymarket-copy-bot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

Run a backtest with default settings:
```bash
python main.py --mode backtest
```

Run paper trading simulation:
```bash
python main.py --mode paper
```

### Generate Sample Data

Generate sample market data and leader trades:
```bash
python main.py --generate-data --periods 1000
```

## Configuration

Edit `src/config.py` to customize settings:

```python
# Market settings
MARKET_NAME = "BTC_15MIN_UP_DOWN"
RESOLUTION_MINUTES = 15
